        <h1>Who am I?</h1> 

        <p>
            On paper, I am an economist from the University of Copenhagen. In life, I am much more than that.
            From the outside, my upbringing seemed pretty normal and suburban, but from the inside of my mind, something was off. For a long time, I walked around like an empty shell, out of touch with myself, simply trying to keep up with the demands and expectations of my surroundings, until one day, when I was compelled to break free. I moved to New York with absolutely no plan in mind and lived there on/off for four years.
            New York had space for me to explore and grow. It was during my time in New York that my interest in art and creativity blossomed. I met some wonderful, inspiring artists and took courses in art history at a university in the city. I was accepted into Sotheby’s and Christie’s art business programs, but unfortunately, due to my mental state, I realized that I had to go back home to Denmark to get help. That was three years ago, and now, I am here, happily working with clay. It has become my mission to share joy through the use of form and color, and bring it into people’s everyday lives.
